This is to ensure that the minimum and maximum width and height data from the previous code block was not caused by outliers/anomalous samples. The findings suggest that the data does in fact contain many smaller samples, with enough to suggest that this is not anomalous and should remain included, however does not include very many large samples. These should be considered whether to be included or not, but given that they are larger and will likely be scaled down, this is less of a concern than if a few very small samples were being scaled up."
